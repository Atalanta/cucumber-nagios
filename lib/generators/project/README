THINGS YOU SHOULD DO
====================

 1. freeze your project
 2. version control your project


Freezing
========

Freezing your dependencies allows you to drop your cucumber-nagios project to
any machine and have it run. Its only requirement is Ruby and Rake.

To freeze your project, run:

 $ rake deps


Redeploying
===========

Just run the freezer again: 

 $ rake deps

Writing features
================

Once you've set up a project, you can use the bin/cucumber-nagios-gen command
to generate new features. It takes two arguments: the site you're testing, and 
feature you're testing: 

  bin/cucumber-nagios-gen feature gnome.org navigation


Version control
===============

I highly recommend storing your cucumber-nagios features in a version control
system!

To get up and running with git: 

 $ git init
 $ git add .
 $ git commit -m 'created cucumber-nagios project'

To get up and running with bzr:

 $ bzr init
 $ bzr add
 $ bzr commit -m 'created cucumber-nagios project'

.bzrignore and .gitignores are created when you generate your project.
