Running tests
=============

Make sure you have the rspec and Cucumber gems installed. 

Cucumber features live under features/. They cover the basics of installing,
creating projects, and running cucumber-nagios. 

Run the features with: 

    $ rake features

They can take a while as they freeze in the dependencies a bunch of times.
